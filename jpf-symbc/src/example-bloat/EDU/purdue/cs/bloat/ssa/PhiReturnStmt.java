/**
 * A PhiReturnStmt is placed at the return site of a subroutine.  This
 * is necessary because variables that are not referrenced inside a 
 * subroutine (finally block) retain their value.  This is a problem
 * for SSA when a variable is assigned to inside an exception handler.
 * At the beginning of the finally block, there would be a merge of 
 * two occurrences of the variable (one from the the exception handler
 * and another from the "outside world") and a phi function should be
 * placed accordingly.  If the type of the variable was changed inside
 * the exception handler, the operands of phi function would be of
 * different types and that would be bad.  To avoid this situation 
 * PhiReturnStmt are placed before the next instruction to be executed
 * after the subroutine has returned.  Note that each PhiReturnStmt
 * has only one operand that is the same variable as its target.  The
 * two variables will have different version numbers, however.
 * <p>
 * The following diagram demonstrates PhiReturnStmt:
 * <pre>
 *                           a1 = 1   a2 = 2
 *                           b1 = 1   b2 = 2
 *                             jsr     jsr
 *                               \     /
 *                                \   /
 *                                 \ /
 *                                  *
 *                        a3 = PhiJoinStmt(a1, a2)
 *                        b3 = PhiJoinStmt(b1, b2)
 *                                  |
 *                               b4 = 4  // b is defined in subrountine
 *                                  |
 *                                 ret
 *                                  *
 *                                 / \
 *                                /   \
 *                               /     \
 *                              /       \
 *             a4 = PhiReturnStmt(a3)  a5 = PhiReturnStmt(a3)
 *             b5 = PhiReturnStmt(b4)  b6 = PhiReturnStmt(b4)
 * </pre>
 * After transformation, the PhiReturnStmts will become
 * <pre>
 *                      a1                    a2
 *                      b4                    b4
 * </pre>
 *
 * The variable <tt>a</tt> is not modified in the subroutine, so it 
 * retains its value from before the jsr.  The variable <tt>b</tt> is
 * modified in the subroutine, so its value after the ret is the
 * value it was assigned in the subroutine.
